									<p> Below are some of the Games I have made using Unity. I will continue to update this page with projects I am working on.

							<!-- Graceful Tree Game -->
								<section>
									<header class="main">
										<h1>Graceful Tree Game</h1>
									</header>

									<p> This is the game I made in Unity using C# based on the graceful tree math conjecture. In the game players must fill the tree nodes with numbers in a 
										way that all differences are unique. The game has a time trial in which when you run out of time you lose. It also has a casual game mode, where you 
										cannot lose, and can determine if you want the difficulty to increase or decrease. 
										You can find the game on Google Play

								<!-- Driving Game -->
								<section>
									<header class="main">
										<h1>Downhill Drift Prototype</h1>
									</header>

									<p> This project started with me trying to learn procedural mesh generation in Unity with C#. I was able to create a potentailly "infinite" road by shifting the mesh as the car drove. 
										Once the mesh generation was working as intended I started add more features to the game. Player options like vibration and rear view mirrors are saved with playerprefs.
										Current vehicle and unlocked cars are saved in a binary file. This demo video is the game in its current state. All models were made by me in Blender.
										I am hoping to release it as a mobile game once everything is completed.

								<!-- Pacman AI -->
								<section>
									<header class="main">
										<h1>Pacman Ghost AI</h1>
									</header>

									<p> The was a school project at Sheridan. Our professor provided us with an project that was missing all the ghost AI. For this I used finite state machines for the ghosts to use to determine there actions.
										The unity Animator window was used as a visual tool to display and alter the Finite State Machine for each ghost. Ghost AI is based on the original Pacman AI. Below is a video which displays the Game 
										as well as one of the Ghosts Finite State Machines as it changes states.

									<header class="main">
										<h1>Arcade Shooter Clone</h1>
									</header>

									<p> This was a school project where we were tasked with creating an arcade inspired shooter in unity. I got all animations from Mixamo. Root Motion was used to move all game characters.
