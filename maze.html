										<h1>Maze Game</h1>
									</header>

									

									<p>The original idea of this project was to create a system of rooms and hallways that could be used to easly create 3D environements for Dungeons and Dragons. Since it was originally inteded for D&D the system 
										was created based on a grid. I than realized that since the system was grid based I could easly create a procedurally generated maze. After some research on how to procedurally create games in unity I started my 
										implimentation. The maze generator works by starting at a 4-way intersection. It than procedurraly generates rooms/ halls based on the direction of previous doorways as well as its surroundings. This allowed for a 
										large random maze to be created where every point was accessable. Once I had created the maze I continued to add more to create a proper game. This includes a player character, endpoint and compass. I than added some bad 
										guys to chase the player as well as the shooting system. The enemies are randomly spawned in rooms near the players current location. I then added a buffs that could be found
										scattered throughout the maze. All the models and animations for the game were made by me in Blender. A quick video of maze generation and game play can be found below. The code for this project can be found here :
